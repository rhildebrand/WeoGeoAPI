# Getting Started with the WeoGeoAPI Python Wrapper

The documentation on all the methods is here: [http://www.weogeo.com/developer_doc/WeoGeo_API_Wrappers_Python.html](http://www.weogeo.com/developer_doc/WeoGeo_API_Wrappers_Python.html)

The workflow to finding, getting metadata and ordering a listing is quite simple.  Think of it this way.

1.  Look in the [WeoGeo Market](http://market.weogeo.com) or your personal [WeoGeo Library](http://www.weogeo.com/library.html) for listings.  The [FindDataOnWeoGeoMarket.py](https://github.com/WeoGeo/WeoGeoAPI/blob/master/examples/getting_started/FindDataOnWeoGeoMarket.py) script shows how this is done with the WeoGeo Market.  You connect, submit a bounding box for an area you are interested in and then it returns all the listings that interset your query.  The [WeoGeo API Documentation](http://www.weogeo.com/developer_doc/Datasets_API.html) has more information on the optional filters you can use to narrow down your search.

2. Once you get your list of datasets that match your search criteria, you can then get more detailed metadata about each listing.  The [GetDataSetInfoWeoGeo.py](https://github.com/WeoGeo/WeoGeoAPI/blob/master/examples/getting_started/GetDataSetInfoWeoGeo.py) script shows how this is done.  You take a dataset token (the unique identifier of each dataset) and submit that to the API.  This will give you the metadata associated with the listing.

3. With that listing token you can customize the dataset so that you get exactly what you are looking for.  We call this creating a [job](http://www.weogeo.com/developer_doc/Jobs_API.html).  A job has all the specific information you need; the format requested, any clipping of the dataset and any layers you wish to get.  The job is just a simple JSON string that tells the WeoGeo servers what you want.  The [GenerateJobWeoGeo.py](https://github.com/WeoGeo/WeoGeoAPI/blob/master/examples/getting_started/GenerateJobWeoGeo.py) script gives an example as to how to author one.  It can be a simple or as complex as you need.

4.  WeoGeo ordering has a cart so that you can create multiple jobs and then order than all at once.  Ordering is where each job is sent to the WeoGeo processor with the expectation of your output.  Ordering is easy because all you have to do is tell the WeoGeo server to execute everything in your cart.  The [OrderJobsinCartWeoGeo.py](https://github.com/WeoGeo/WeoGeoAPI/blob/master/examples/getting_started/OrderJobsinCartWeoGeo.py) script shows how this is done.  You can also individually order each job, check out the Python API documentation [job methods](http://www.weogeo.com/developer_doc/WeoGeo_API_Wrappers_Python.html#job_methods) <code>orderJob</code> syntax.  When you submit a job to the API, you get a job token returned.  This job token is what you use to call that specific job.  Generally ordering the cart is easier, but sometimes you just want to order a specific job.

5.  WeoGeo order run in the background.  You'll receive an email telling you a job is ready but you can also use the API to query.  [DownloadJobWeoGeo.py](https://github.com/WeoGeo/WeoGeoAPI/blob/master/examples/getting_started/DownloadJobWeoGeo.py) shows how you use the job token and <code>getDownloadFile()</code> to accomplish this.  This method returns a 400 until the job is ready.  You can keep checking until you get a 200 response and the download url.  You can then use a wget to download the file.
